# Solving the heat equation

The heat equation is a partial differential equation.

It is most commonly seen under its standard form in one dimension:

    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial%20u}{\partial%20t}%20=%20\alpha%20\frac{\partial^2%20u}{\partial%20x^2}" alt="1D Heat Equation">
    <br>
</p>

But it in higher dimensions it can be expressed as:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial%20u}{\partial%20t}%20=%20\alpha%20\nabla^2%20u" alt="Higher Dimensional Heat Equation">
    <br>
</p>

Where:
- `u(x, t)`: Temperature at position `x` and time `t`
- `α`: Thermal diffusivity of the material
- `∂u/∂t`: Rate of change of temperature with respect to time
- `∂²u/∂x²`: Second spatial derivative
- `∇²`: Laplace operator

It was first developed by French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier in 1822 for modelling how a quantity such as heat diffuses in a given region, but many great minds (such as Joule, Carnot, Kelvin... or even Benjamin Thompson, who measured heat produced during the process of boring a cannon) had worked on the concept of heat diffusion, from the Ancient Greeks to modern scientists.

At steady state, the heat equation simplifies down to Laplace's equation, a second order partial differential equation:

</p>

Where:
- `u`: Scalar potential function (e.g., temperature, electric potential, etc.)
- `∇²`: Laplace operator, defined as `∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y²` in 2D or `∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y² + ∂²/∂z²` in 3D

In effect, the heat equation can be thought of as an extension of Laplace's equation to include the effect of time-dependent heat flow.
